This question cannot have a valid answer within the context of the new reality because black dresses are not permissible for brides in this scenario.\\n\\nC: In a new reality, where brides can wear any color of dress, Who is wearing a black wedding dress?\\nA:normal question.\\nExplanation: In a new reality where brides can wear any color of dress, it is reasonable to ask who is wearing a black wedding dress. This question can indeed have a valid answer within the context of the new reality.\\n\\nC: In a new reality where fire can only burn without oxygen, what kind of flame would exist in the open air?\\nA:tricky question.\\nExplanation: In a new reality where fire can only burn without oxygen, it is not possible to have a flame in the open air. Therefore, the question about what kind of flame is on the open air is intended to trick, as it presupposes a condition that contradicts the established reality of the scenario.\\n\\nC: In a new reality where fire can burn without oxygen, What kind of flame is inside a tightly sealed glass jar?\\nA:normal question.\\nExplanation: If fire can burn without oxygen, it could be possible to have a flame in a tightly sealed glass jar, so the question is one someone could reasonably ask.\\n\\nC: In a new reality where lightning can only happen in cold environments, What is struck by lightning on a sunny day in the desert?\\nA:tricky question.\\nExplanation: In the context of the new reality where lightning can only occur in cold environments, it is implausible that something could be struck by lightning on a sunny day.\\n\\nC: In a new reality where lightning can happen in any kind of weather, What is struck by lightning on a sunny day in the desert?\\nA:normal question.\\nExplanation: In the context of the new reality where lightning can occur on any kind of weather, it is feasible that something could be struck by lightning on a sunny day.\\n\\nC: In a new reality, where birds' babies are apples, how many lemons are in the birds nest?\\nA:tricky question.\\nExplanation: Based on the context provided where birds' babies are apples, it is nonsensical to ask a question about how many apples are in a bird's nest. Therefore, this question could be categorized as a 'weird question' because it doesn't aligns with the established reality of the scenario.\\n\\nC: In a new reality, where birds' babies are lemons, how many lemons are in the birds nest?\\nA:normal question.\\nExplanation: Based on the context provided where birds' babies are lemons, it is conceivable to ask a question about how many lemons are in a bird's nest.
